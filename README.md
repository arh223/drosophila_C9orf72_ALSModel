#### For the manuscript, "Second-site Modifiers of the Drosophila C9orf72 Model for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis," we have included the code used to run the genome wide association studies using a linear mixed model and the RNA-sequencing. The files "LinearMixedModel.R" and "manhattan_plot.R" correspond to the genome wide association studies and the "deseq2_analysis.R", "deseq2_personal_func.R", "qc.py", "qc_functions.py", and "qc_functions.pyc" correspond to the RNA-sequencing.
